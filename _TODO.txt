===== TODO ===== FEEL FREE TO PUT YOUR OWN REQUESTS HERE, ALSO FEEL FREE TO IMPLEMENT ANYTHING ON THAT LIST, PLEASE HELP!!! :-D (o = open, ok = done, higher priority is on top)

o actually i have some redundancy here
groupadd/useradd -> could be done via reusing recordadd
... but of course does recordadd then need to know what type of record it is dealing with (user/group) and do the additional steps needed (create a group for every new user)

ok step through lib_mysqli_commands.test.php
... an implement what is needed to manage users/groups/records.

ok move the library one folder up, having library and projectname in the same folder.

ok add

#CONVENTION:1
ook call all webbrowser-usable-php files frontend_Something.php
ook call all backend-serverside-endpoints files backend_Something.php
ook call all library functions ./lib/php/lib_Seomthing.php

#CONVENTION:2 table languages
... that keeps all the text-translations, there will be a function translate("keyword"); that outputs the translation, depending on the detected browser/os language.

#CONVENTION:3 connecting different databases
to connect a different database, you need to write two files:

#CONVENTION:4 client<->server communication
right now it seems like the "easiest"/most transparent way of client-server-com to
4.1. that the client transmits a custom forged query string ("backend.php?key1=value1&key2=value2")
...so you know what is going on/transmitted and how it is transmitted.

#CONVENTION:5 database objects e.g. user
what if you want to add additional info to the passwd table?
e.g. newProperty
no problem!
just add it in the database, and the getUser(); functions will (hopefully) return an appropriate stdClass object,
you can access your newProperty via $user->newProperty; 

4.2. the server responds with an json_encoded array from database (echo json_encode($result_array);)
...because it is easy to process such objects in javascript.

1. ./class/php/class_mysqli_interface.php -> that implements the connection buildup/setup/auth for your favourite database.
2. ./lib/php/lib_mysqli_commands.php -> that implements the available commands (login, register, adduser...) that gigalaunch.de needs to work with your favourite database.

if($settings_datasource == "mysql") 

o test the system according to test-documentation
oo login
oo register
oo add user
oo change user
oo delete user

o created editable list, vorting feature

o automated database installation

projectname beeing a test-dash, that allows to test all the functionalities
oo client<->server communication (add, change, delete)

o separate login into login.html (frontend) frontend_login.php (backend) 

o go through test-doc and release new release

o auth/register via facebook/badoo (chinese facebook!)
... is there a russian facebook?

o also on focusout validate username

o display error messages when server/database/table is not available (is not displayed properly)
(see test documentation)

o implement paging (for up/downloading a lot of data... partial download/display data -> editable jquery datagrid?)
2.1. write
2.1.1. write A LOT (paging?)
2.2. change
2.2.1. change A LOT (paging?)
2.3. read
2.3.1. read A LOT (paging?)

o file operations
  - file upload
      - upload with paging? ( i have no idea how this could be done )
  - file download
      - luckily this works without paging
  - file change/update
      - php timeout, could also be a problem with larger files
  - file delete
      - php timeout should be enough to delete almost any file of any size

o as many cool widgets into demo content.php as possible
1. chat
2. comments
3. wiki
4. forum

ok immediate feedback after user registration
ook submit form via ajax

ok problem:http://forum.jquery.com/topic/login-problems-with-redirects
 href instead of change page... and <a href instead of button onclick -> change page, because otherwise jqmobile does not reinitialize the javascript includes (ARGH!)
... last try with client side page transition. if that fails. (complete reload of all javascript resources of the page)
the only option is either php->header->redirect or php->message-answer, but can not do both. (output message from server, wait 3 seconds, than load a new page)
... same problem.

						function refreshPage() {
							  $.mobile.changePage(
							    window.location.href,
							    {
							      allowSamePageTransition : true,
							      transition              : 'none',
							      showLoadMsg             : false,
							      reloadPage              : true
							    }
							  );
							}
