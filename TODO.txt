===== TODO ===== FEEL FREE TO PUT YOUR OWN REQUESTS HERE, ALSO FEEL FREE TO IMPLEMENT ANYTHING ON THAT LIST, PLEASE HELP!!! :-D (o = open, ok = done, higher priority is on top)

ok move the library one folder up, having library and projectname in the same folder.

#CONVENTION:1
ook call all webbrowser-usable-php files frontend_Something.php
ook call all backend-serverside-endpoints files backend_Something.php
ook call all library functions lib_Seomthing.php

o test the system according to test-documentation
oo login
oo register
oo add user
oo change user
oo delete user

o created editable list, vorting feature

o automated database installation

projectname beeing a test-dash, that allows to test all the functionalities
oo client<->server communication (add, change, delete)

o separate login into login.html (frontend) frontend_login.php (backend) 

o go through test-doc and release new release

o auth/register via facebook/badoo (chinese facebook!)
... is there a russian facebook?

o also on focusout validate username

o display error messages when server/database/table is not available (is not displayed properly)
(see test documentation)

o implement paging (for up/downloading a lot of data... partial download/display data -> editable jquery datagrid?)
2.1. write
2.1.1. write A LOT (paging?)
2.2. change
2.2.1. change A LOT (paging?)
2.3. read
2.3.1. read A LOT (paging?)

o file operations
  - file upload
      - upload with paging? ( i have no idea how this could be done )
  - file download
      - luckily this works without paging
  - file change/update
      - php timeout, could also be a problem with larger files
  - file delete
      - php timeout should be enough to delete almost any file of any size

o as many cool widgets into demo content.php as possible
1. chat
2. comments
3. wiki
4. forum

ok immediate feedback after user registration
ook submit form via ajax

ok problem:http://forum.jquery.com/topic/login-problems-with-redirects
 href instead of change page... and <a href instead of button onclick -> change page, because otherwise jqmobile does not reinitialize the javascript includes (ARGH!)
... last try with client side page transition. if that fails. (complete reload of all javascript resources of the page)
the only option is either php->header->redirect or php->message-answer, but can not do both. (output message from server, wait 3 seconds, than load a new page)
... same problem.

						function refreshPage() {
							  $.mobile.changePage(
							    window.location.href,
							    {
							      allowSamePageTransition : true,
							      transition              : 'none',
							      showLoadMsg             : false,
							      reloadPage              : true
							    }
							  );
							}
